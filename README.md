# MECH350
Code for the controls portion of the MECH 350 Project

# Python Program
Execution of the python program requires python3 installed on your computer. It can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

pySerial is also required. This can be installed via pip from the command line with ```pip install pyserial``` once python3 is installed. 

This program takes user input on which serial port to use to connect to an Arduino programmed with the Arduino code and allows the user to pass it instructions on how far to travel the arm or how high to tilt the tray.
